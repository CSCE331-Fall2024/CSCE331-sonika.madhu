                <p class = p1> Howdy! I am currently a Computer Science major at Texas A&M University with an emphasis in Statistics. 
                With my background in programming and mathematics, I have evolved into someone with a love for taking on challenges 
                and finding innovative solutions. I strive to bring a fresh perspective to every project I work on and am driven by my passion, curiosity, and enthusiasm for what I do. 
                I am also someone who believes that the best work happens when people come together with a shared vision and an open mind. 
                I pride myself on my ability to bring out the best in others while contributing my own unique insights which has contributed to my success in team projects 
                involving building x86-64 computer architecture and AI data prediction models.

                I also believe mindfulness is the key to a good work-life balance so I spend my time practicing yoga, hiking, and taking walks.
