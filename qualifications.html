                <p> My technical interest in front-end software design and AI comes from my passion for creating engaging and intuitive user experiences while harnessing the power of intelligent systems. I love front-end design because it allows me to bring creative ideas to life, ensuring that users interact with software in a seamless and visually appealing way. For me, it’s about understanding user behavior, having a keen eye for design, and implementing responsive, dynamic interfaces using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By integrating AI, I can take this a step further, making applications more adaptive, personalized, and capable of solving complex problems. For me, the combination of front-end development and AI is where creativity meets cutting-edge technology, enabling me to design and build smarter, more user-centric applications. </p>
